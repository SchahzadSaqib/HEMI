# Longitudinal analysis of vaginal microbiota during IVF fresh embryo transfer and in early pregnancy  
- **Supplement Table 1**. Summary statistics of permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Subject characteristics were tested to identify potential effects on the microbial profiles of the vaginal samples. Df = Degrees of freedom, SumOfSqs = Sum of squares, R2 = partial R-squared, F_statistic = pseudo F-statistic, Pr_stat = p-value, Sigif = Significance. 

- **Supplement Table 2**. Reasons for withdrawal of the fresh embryo transfer. 

- **Supplement Figure 1**. An alluvial plot showing the intra-individual changes in the composition of the vaginal microbiota based on the most abundant species between the different time points. 

- **Supplement Figure 2**. A boxplot indicating the richness and diversity of the vaginal microbiota divided based on the pregnancy/non-pregnancy after fresh IVF-ET. 

- **Supplement Figure 3**. All 75 samples taken at the time of the fresh embryo transfer and 21 samples taken at the 8th gestational week of pregnancy sorted into community state types (CSTs) using the VALENCIA classification tool.
